# Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator – Web Edition (Enhanced UI)

## 📌 Overview
This is **version 3** of the Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator.  
It is a **web-based application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with an improved frontend UI.  
The app implements the same underlying mathematical model as previous versions but offers a **user-friendly interface** for entering vehicle data and calculating total ownership costs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Convert the console-based calculator (version 1) into a fully web-based tool  
- Provide interactive input for multiple vehicle parameters  
- Display Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and residual values in a clear format  
- Improve **frontend skills** and build an accessible UI  

---

## 🖥️ Pages
- **Home Page** – Overview of the application, instructions, and navigation to the calculator  
- **Calculator Page** – Enter vehicle data and usage parameters; calculates TCO including purchase, maintenance, operating, service, ancillary costs, and residual value  

This two-page structure separates guidance from functionality, making the app more intuitive and easier to use.

## 🧮 Cost Components
- Initial Purchase Cost  
- Depreciation (reducing balance method)  
- Maintenance Costs (tyres, brake pads, fluids, etc.)  
- Operating Costs (fuel consumption, insurance)  
- Service Costs (periodic servicing, emissions testing)  
- Ancillary Costs (car washing, miscellaneous expenses)  
- Residual Value (estimated resale value after ownership period)  

---

## ⚙️ Assumptions
- Fuel price remains constant over the ownership period  
- All wear components are brand new at purchase  
- Distance traveled is fixed (user-specified)  
- Lease payments excluded during usage  
- Vehicle is purchased for resale after the defined period  
- Maximum ownership lifespan capped at 10 years  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Further enhance **UI/UX** design  
- Add **charts/visualizations** for cost comparisons  
- Enable saving/loading vehicle data  
- Allow dynamic adjustments for fuel prices, depreciation, and other economic factors
